This is example Flow App was created to demonstrate walletless onboarding and promote composable, secure, and smooth UX for on-chain games without the need for a traditional backend. It uses an on-chain Rock Paper Scissors game and NFT "Marketplace" as a proof of concept exploration into the world of blockchain gaming and hybrid custody powered by Cadence on Flow.
